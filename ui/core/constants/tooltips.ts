	'*** WARNING - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ***\n\nThe entire concept of a healing sim is EXPERIMENTAL. All results should be taken with an EXTREMELY large grain of salt.\n\nThis tool is currently more similar to a spreadsheet than a true sim. Options for specifying incoming damage profiles in order to have proper reactive rotations have not yet been added.';
